# skillCraft-project1

I've created the complete, single-file responsive landing page in the canvas called Responsive-landing-page. Open the file on the right (titled responsive-landing-page.html) to view, edit, or download the HTML/CSS/JS.
What I included:
Fixed, accessible navigation that changes style on scroll and highlights the active section.
Hover micro-interactions for menu items and buttons.
obile-friendly hamburger menu with slide-in panel.
Background video hero, gallery, features, contact form (demo submit), and footer.
Smooth scrolling and IntersectionObserver-based active link highlighting.
Clear spots commented where you can replace images/videos and text.
If you want, I can:
Convert this to a React/Tailwind component.
Swap the hero video for an embedded YouTube/Vimeo video.
Add animations with Framer Motion or micro-interactions with more JS.
Provide a polished export (zip) or a downloadable ZIP of the file.
